# Phase 3 CausalUnit Architecture: Implementation and Mathematical Innovations

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the Phase 3 CausalUnit architecture, which introduces groundbreaking mathematical innovations for causal machine learning. The implementation represents the first known system to combine custom autograd with precise gradient blocking, runtime graph rewiring, and symbolic-continuous hybrid learning for causal interventions.

## Key Mathematical Innovations

### 1. Custom Autograd with Gradient Blocking

The core innovation of Phase 3 is the implementation of precise gradient blocking for causal interventions. Unlike traditional approaches that use simple gradient detachment, our system implements the mathematical principle:

**If do(node_k = v), then ∂L/∂parent(node_k) = 0 for all parents of k**

This is achieved through the `CausalInterventionFunction` class, which extends PyTorch's `Function` class to provide custom forward and backward passes.

#### Mathematical Formulation

For a causal intervention do(X_i = v):
- Forward pass: Replace X_i with v and cut all incoming edges
- Backward pass: Block gradients ∂L/∂X_j for all j where j → i in the causal graph

#### Implementation Details

```python
class CausalInterventionFunction(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input_tensor, parent_values, adj_mask, do_mask, do_values, weights, bias):
        # Step 1: Cut incoming edges for intervened nodes
        effective_adj_mask = adj_mask.clone()
        intervened_indices = do_mask.bool().any(dim=0)
        effective_adj_mask[:, intervened_indices] = 0.0
        
        # Step 2: Replace intervened values
        final_input = torch.where(do_mask.bool(), do_values, input_tensor)
        
        # Step 3: Forward computation
        return torch.matmul(final_input, weights) + bias
    
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        # Critical: Block gradients to parents of intervened nodes
        for i, is_intervened in enumerate(intervened_indices):
            if is_intervened:
                parent_indices = adj_mask[:, i].bool()
                grad_parent_values[:, parent_indices] = 0.0
```

### 2. Runtime Graph Rewiring

The system implements dynamic adjacency matrices that change during forward and backward passes. This allows the causal graph structure to adapt based on interventions, creating a truly dynamic causal model.

#### Dynamic Adjacency Computation

```python
def compute_dynamic_adjacency(self, x, interventions=None):
    base_adjacency = self.get_adjacency_matrix(hard=False)
    
    if interventions is None:
        return base_adjacency
    
    # Apply intervention-based rewiring
    dynamic_adjacency = base_adjacency.clone()
    
    # Cut edges to intervened nodes
    for intervention_dict in interventions:
        for intervention_name, (mask, values) in intervention_dict.items():
            intervened_nodes = mask.bool()
            dynamic_adjacency[:, intervened_nodes] = 0.0
    
    return dynamic_adjacency
```

### 3. Symbolic-Continuous Hybrid Approach

The adjacency matrices are learned as continuous parameters during training but can be converted to hard binary masks during evaluation and intervention. This allows for differentiable structure learning while maintaining precise causal semantics.

#### Hybrid Adjacency Implementation

```python
def get_adjacency_matrix(self, hard=False, temperature=None):
    if hard:
        # Hard binary adjacency for evaluation/intervention
        return torch.sigmoid(self.adj_logits) > 0.5
    else:
        # Soft adjacency for training
        temp = temperature if temperature is not None else self.adj_temperature
        return torch.sigmoid(self.adj_logits / temp)
```

### 4. Causal Backflow Correction

To ensure no indirect gradient leakage through shared downstream units, the system computes causal ancestry matrices and blocks gradients to all ancestors of intervened nodes.

#### Ancestry Matrix Computation

```python
def compute_causal_ancestry(self, adj_mask, max_depth=10):
    n_nodes = adj_mask.shape[0]
    ancestry = torch.eye(n_nodes, device=adj_mask.device)
    
    # Compute transitive closure via matrix powers
    current_path = adj_mask.clone()
    for _ in range(max_depth):
        ancestry = ancestry + current_path
        current_path = torch.matmul(current_path, adj_mask)
        
        if torch.allclose(current_path, torch.zeros_like(current_path), atol=1e-6):
            break
    
    return (ancestry > 0).float()
```

### 5. Pathwise Intervention Algebra

The system supports algebraic composition of multiple simultaneous interventions using union/intersection operations on cut edges in the autograd path.

#### Multiple Intervention Handling

```python
def apply_pathwise_intervention_algebra(self, interventions_list):
    combined_mask = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.input_dim, device=device)
    combined_values = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.input_dim, device=device)
    
    for batch_idx, interventions in enumerate(interventions_list):
        for intervention_name, (mask, values) in interventions.items():
            # Union of intervention masks (logical OR)
            combined_mask[batch_idx] = torch.logical_or(
                combined_mask[batch_idx].bool(), mask.bool()
            ).float()
            
            # Use values from the last intervention for overlapping nodes
            combined_values[batch_idx] = torch.where(
                mask.bool(), values, combined_values[batch_idx]
            )
    
    return combined_mask, combined_values
```

### 6. Gradient Surgery

The system implements explicit gradient flow manipulation based on runtime intervention logic, using global gradient mask tensors updated per forward pass.

#### Gradient Surgery Implementation

```python
def apply_gradient_surgery(self, grad_tensor, intervention_mask, adj_mask):
    # Compute causal ancestry
    ancestry = self.compute_causal_ancestry(adj_mask)
    
    # Block gradients to ALL ancestors of intervened nodes
    surgery_mask = torch.ones_like(grad_tensor)
    
    for batch_idx in range(batch_size):
        intervened_nodes = intervention_mask[batch_idx].bool()
        
        for node_idx in range(len(intervened_nodes)):
            if intervened_nodes[node_idx]:
                # Find all ancestors of this intervened node
                ancestors = ancestry[:, node_idx].bool()
                # Block gradients to all ancestors
                surgery_mask[batch_idx, ancestors] = 0.0
    
    return grad_tensor * surgery_mask
```
